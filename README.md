## About
[Strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) project description: A script to bootstrap a minimal macOS development system.
Installs the minimal set of software every macOS developer will want.

Strap authorizes with Github before generating a personalized setup shell script, which allows it to look for this repo in order to automate the installation of things included in the Brewfile.

Strap can also be configured to look for a `dotfiles` repo that can help setup common configuration files.
